As the switch will trigger both a “short release” and a “long release” when the button is released after a long release period, 
the blueprints prevent the short release. 
The blueprints needs a toggle helper for this to work. 
Please create manually before setting up the automation. 
Go to “Settings” - “Devices and Services” - “Helpers” - “Create Helper” - “Toggle”. The name can be whatever.
